## Evaluation

Evaluation tool chain is used to compare PackGenome-generated rules with public-availabe packer signature collections (i.e., human-written YARA rules and Detect It Easy) and a state-of-the-art automatic YARA rule generation tool (i.e., AutoYara). 

### Requirement

- `AutoYara`-https://github.com/NeuromorphicComputationResearchProgram/AutoYara
- `Detect It Easy(3.06)`-https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy

### Configuration

[Evaluation/EvaluationConfig.json](https://github.com/packgenome/PackGenome-Artifacts/blob/main/Evaluation/configs/EvaluationConfig.json) contains configuration options related to evaluation experiments. The key options excerpted from the configuration file are as follows.

```json
"packgenome_rule": "", 		// Path of compiled PackGenome-genearted YARA rule
"artificial_rule": "",      // Path of compiled collected human-written YARA rule
"autoyara_rule": "",		// Path of compiled AutoYara-genearted YARA rule
"test_mode": "",			// Evaluation mode: tagon/non
"thread": "8",				// Thread of yara test
"LPD_testset": "",			// Path of LPD dataset
"LPD1_testset": "",			// Path of LPD1 dataset
"NPD_testset": "",			// Path of NPD dataset
"accessible_packers": [],	// Off-the-shelf packers for evaluation 
"inaccessible_packers": []	// Inaccessible packers for evaluation 
```

### Experiments

We provide three evaluation experiments in this artifact.

- Matching off-the-shelf label packed programs

  LPD dataset contains non-malicious programs packed by 20 off-the-shelf packers. We calculate the FPR, FNR, TDR of all the rules on the LPD dataset.

  ```sh
  sh acc_eval.sh
  ```

- Matching inaccessible label packed programs

  LPD1 dataset contains non-malicious programs packed by 5 inaccessible packers. We calculate the FPR, FNR, TDR of all the rules on the LPD1 dataset.

  ```sh
  sh inacc_eval.sh

- Matching non-packed programs

  NPD dataset contains real-world benign programs. We use the NPD dataset to measure the false positives rate that rules mistakenly match the non-packed programs. We calculate the FPR, TDR of all the rules on the LPD dataset.

  ```sh
  sh nonpack_eval.sh
  ```

After executing the above three command, `acc_lpd.txt`, `inacc_lpd1.txt` and `acc_npd.txt` will be generated in the `Evaluation/result` folder. `acc_lpd.txt` records the FPR, FNR, TDR of all tools for 20 off-the-shelf packers. `inacc_lpd1.txt` records the FPR, FNR, TDR of all tools for 5 inaccessible packers. `acc_npd.txt` records the FPR, TDR of all tools on the NPD dataset.
